### Transformers Gen (temporary repo until idea comes)

### Quick start
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
download datasets
```bash
python3 prepare_data.py
```

### Hosted idea:
1. First understand and build simple transformer
2. Train and optimize on different datasets
3. Different types of language models
4. A nice front-end where you can choose between each
5. Do this more for research and innovation
